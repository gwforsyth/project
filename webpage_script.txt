              	<h1> Bioinformatics project </h1>
                The BS32011 module was a practical module where bioinformatics skills were learnt. This involved learning how to use python and MySQL databases. Part of the project was to create a database which could be queried using certain commands. 
	<h4> This section is an example of one of the queries which was computed</h4>
	<form  method=POST action=cgi-bin/script.py>
        <table><tr>
        	<td>select gene_id from Gene:</td>
        	<td><input type=text name=query></td>
        	<td><input type="submit" value="submit"></td>
        </tr></table>
	</form>
        </body>
